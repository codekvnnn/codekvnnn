## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Kevin

I am a **senior software engineer** with a deep focus on **building scalable, high-impact products** that bridge front-end experiences with back-end efficiency. My work is driven by a strong foundation in **software architecture, API integrations, and developer experience**, ensuring that every solution I build is not only technically robust but also aligned with business and user needs.  

With expertise in **modern front-end frameworks** such as React, Vue.js, and Angular, I craft interfaces that prioritize **usability, performance, and accessibility**. I have a keen understanding of **design systems and user experience principles**, allowing me to translate complex requirements into intuitive applications.  

On the back end, I design and develop **scalable APIs, microservices, and cloud-native applications**, leveraging technologies like **Node.js, Python, and Java**. My experience extends to **database design, distributed systems, and performance optimization**, ensuring that applications are both resilient and efficient.  

Beyond writing code, I take a **product-first approach to engineering**, always considering **how technical decisions impact usability, scalability, and long-term maintainability**. I collaborate closely with cross-functional teamsâ€”including product managers, designers, and business stakeholdersâ€”to align technology with strategic objectives.  

I am also deeply invested in **technical leadership and knowledge sharing**, mentoring teams on best practices in **software architecture, DevOps, and API design**. My experience with **AWS, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and CI/CD pipelines** allows me to drive automation, efficiency, and scalability in software development.  

Whether it's building **robust engineering solutions, optimizing developer experience, or driving architectural decisions**, my goal is to deliver **scalable, maintainable, and impactful technology** that meets both **business goals and user expectations**.  

ðŸ“© **Let's connect**â€”Iâ€™m always open to discussing **technology, product development, and engineering leadership**.
